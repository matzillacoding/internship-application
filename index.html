                                    During my self-employment in E-commerce, I focused on various tasks, including the continuous optimization of the company's website. 
                                    This involved adapting different templates, implementing new functionalities, and enhancing the user experience. 
                                    While working on these programming tasks, I discovered that they were significantly more interesting and fulfilling than the 
                                    implementation of business-related processes. With the opportunity for retraining and the associated entry into professional 
                                    application development, I decided to cease my self-employment and dedicate all my energy to training.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    This retraining corresponds to a state-supported education program for a Specialist in Application Development, with a shortened 
                                    duration of two years. The academic content includes acquiring fundamental IT skills, IT professional qualifications, as well as 
                                    certifications such as OCA (Oracle Certified Associate Java) and Agil Scrum Foundation. The retraining includes a mandatory 
                                    nine-month internship, taking place from May 6, 2024, to January 29, 2025. In addition to being eligible for the IHK examination, 
                                    the internship aims to gain extended practical skills and insights into the real working life of an IT company. In this regard, 
                                    I am applying for an internship position with your company and look forward to learning from you and contributing the newly acquired 
                                    knowledge to your organization.

                    <p>
                        With an internship in your company, I hope to expand my professional skills and look forward to applying this knowledge to the 
                        daily tasks of your business. Problem-solving in programming and adapting applications has fascinated me since my first 
                        encounter with the subject. It is mandatory to carry out a company-related project, which constitutes a significant part of 
                        the IHK final exam and is evaluated with 50% of the overall grade. Naturally, company-specific content will be preserved in 
                        accordance with your specifications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am confident that with my commitment and skills, I can make a positive contribution to your team. What makes this opportunity 
                        particularly appealing is that the internship will be undertaken without financial compensation. This allows you to benefit from my 
                        enthusiasm and work ethic without incurring additional costs. Furthermore, I see my internship as an opportunity not only to gain 
                        valuable experience but also to familiarize myself as a potential future employee with the processes and corporate culture. 
                        This perspective could create a long-term win-win situation for both parties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regardless of the total duration of nine months, the actual presence in your company amounts to six months. 
                        This is due to interruptions caused by school exam preparation and the administration of written final exams.

                        During my professional experiences before my current training, I focused on technologies in the field of web development. 
                        My expertise included HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with basic knowledge of the jQuery library and the Bootstrap framework. 
                        Additionally, through self-study, I gained fundamental skills in the Java programming language.

                        The Oracle Certified Associate exam is scheduled to take place later in the course of my training. 
                        To further enhance my knowledge in my personal area of interest, I obtained relevant certifications in the JavaScript programming language.

                        <p>
                            So far, during my training as an IT specialist, I have covered a wide range of topics that have deepened my 
                            understanding and skills in the IT field. With a focus on application development, subjects such as control 
                            structures, object-oriented programming, Clean Code, and interfaces were addressed. Additional areas such as 
                            networks, cyber-physical systems, IT security, and project management were also part of the curriculum.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to the technical aspects, commercial topics played a crucial role. The integration of business 
                            knowledge allows me not only to comprehend technical solutions but also to assess their economic impacts 
                            and make informed decisions that consider both technical and economic requirements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With an average grade of 1.2, I can look back on a positively progressing course of my education. This evaluation 
                            is intended to reflect my commitment in the context of this application and highlight my ability to comprehend 
                            and successfully implement complex subjects. I aim to continue this development during the internship at your company.
