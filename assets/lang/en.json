    "aboutSection_1": "During my self-employment in E-commerce, I focused on various tasks, including the continuous optimization of the company's website. This involved adapting different templates, implementing new functionalities, and enhancing the user experience. While working on these programming tasks, I discovered that they were significantly more interesting and fulfilling than the implementation of business-related processes. With the opportunity for retraining and the associated entry into professional application development, I decided to cease my self-employment and dedicate all my energy to training.",
    "aboutSection_2": "This retraining corresponds to a state-supported education program for a Specialist in Application Development, with a shortened duration of two years. The academic content includes acquiring fundamental IT skills, IT professional qualifications, as well as certifications such as OCA (Oracle Certified Associate Java) and Agil Scrum Foundation. The retraining includes a mandatory  nine-month internship, taking place from May 6, 2024, to January 29, 2025. In addition to being eligible for the IHK examination, the internship aims to gain extended practical skills and insights into the real working life of an IT company. In this regard, I am applying for an internship position with your company and look forward to learning from you and contributing the newly acquired knowledge to your organization.",

    "internshipDate": "May 6th, 2024 - January 29th, 2025",
    "internshipSection_1": "With an internship in your company, I hope to expand my professional skills and look forward to applying this knowledge to the daily tasks of your business. Problem-solving in programming and adapting applications has fascinated me since my first encounter with the subject. It is mandatory to carry out a company-related project, which constitutes a significant part of the IHK final exam and is evaluated with 50% of the overall grade. Naturally, company-specific content will be preserved in accordance with your specifications.",
    "internshipSection_2": "I am confident that with my commitment and skills, I can make a positive contribution to your team. What makes this opportunity particularly appealing is that the internship will be undertaken without financial compensation. This allows you to benefit from my enthusiasm and work ethic without incurring additional costs. Furthermore, I see my internship as an opportunity not only to gain valuable experience but also to familiarize myself as a potential future employee with the processes and corporate culture. This perspective could create a long-term win-win situation for both parties.",
    "internshipSection_3": "During the internship, a company-related project is to be carried out, which constitutes a significant part of the IHK final exam and is graded with 50% of the overall grade. Of course, company-specific content and internal information will be fully respected according to your specifications. Regardless of the total duration of nine months, the actual presence in your company amounts to six months. This is due to interruptions caused by school exam preparation and the administration of written final exams. You can find a detailed overview of the timeline and its contents in the following link.",
